Usage of MADneSs Framewok

* How to Run MADneSs

- MADneSs comes as a JAR file. 
- JAR files can be run from command line as "java -jar <filepath>.jar".
- You need Java 8 to run the framework.

* Input Files

- Input files may contain comments, which are rows starting with a "*"
- MADneSs looks for a preferences file "madness.preferences" located in the same folder of the JAR executable. Each row of the file contains its own explanation. This preferences file provides links to other input files / folders.
- "scoringPreferences.preferences" file: here we define strategies to vote the results of each anomaly checker.
- "configurations" folder: contains a "*.conf" file for each algorithm implemented in MADneSs. Each file describes the possible combinations for input paramaters of the given algorithm. Each combination is examined during training phase.
- "loaders" folder: contains "*.loader" files. Each loader specifies how to fetch data from a data source. Data sources may be i) MYSQL databases, or ii) CSV files. Each loader file has an internal explanation of its fields.
- "setup" folder: contains different files:
-- "algorithmPreferences.preferences" file: specifies which algorithms should be considered for the training / evaluation phase of MADneSs. It is possible to choose a single algorithm, or a set of algorithms. In the latter case, algorithms should be comma-separated.
-- "dataSeries.preferences" file: defines how to build data series, if just with PLAIN data, or building also on DIFF (first order differences).
-- "validationMetrics.preferences" file: lists the metrics that should be reported in the output files. To set the reference metric, see "madness.preferences" file.

* Intermediate Files
Partial scores are generated and put in a temporary folder, as well as support files for algorithms which require to save training data in separate files e.g., iTrees of the iForest.

* Output Files
MADneSs outputs scores obtained at the end of the evaluation process. The usual output is a set of textual, CSV files. If needed, the user may want to choose a graphical output for the scores of the data points. In this case, see "madness.preferences" file.
