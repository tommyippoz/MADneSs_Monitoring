If it is a JAR file: just run the java -jar command
When using an IDE: run configuration having ippoz.multilayer.detector.executable.DetectorMain as main class

MADneSs mainly refers to a primary preferences file, namely "detector.preferences", which should be located 
in the same folder of the project / JAR archive. This file mainly defines the following bullets.

- Data Loader Preferences
It defines the file / archive / db that should be used ad data base. LOADERS defines paths to a "*.loader" file with all the additional information needed for loading such data.

- MADneSs Execution Preferences
Sets the execution mode of MADneSs. If a whole training is needed, the flags FILTERING_FLAG and TRAIN_FLAG must be
set to 1. 0 otherwise.

- MADneSs Setup
Defines the parameters for the execution of MADneSs. More in detail, the following options should be specified:
-- METRIC defines the reference scoring metric e.g., FMEASURE
-- METRIC_TYPE defines if the metric should be considered as "absolute" or "relative" value. It applies only to some 
	metrics, as for example True Positives. Example of absolute is "4 True Positives", relative is "12% are True 
	Positives"
-- ANOMALY_WINDOW positive integer number representing the window in which we expect to observe the effect of the 
	injected faults after their activation e.g., 2 seconds.  
-- REPUTATION currently not implemented, set default to 1.0
-- FILTERING_TRESHOLD used while filtering data series at the beginning. A data series is discarded if it has a 
	FPR value on the GOLDEN data which is lower than a given threshold, which is specified here. Threshold should be
	a number between 0 and 1. 
-- VALID_AFTER_INJECTION a boolean (true / false). Specifies if the calculation of the metric values must stop 
	after the first TP / FN, or if it should go until the end of the data trace.
-- DATA_SERIES_DOMAIN it defines a threshold for the composed data series. A composed data series is created 
	between two simple data series if they show some kind of connection. This is calculated by specific indexes,
	as for example the Pearson Index. If we want to create composed data series that have at least a given
	Pearson Correlation, say 98%, we can write "PEARSON(0.98)"
-- OUTPUT_TYPE defines the type of the intermediate outputs of MADneSs. They can be either null, image, or text.

- Files Preferences
Specifies the paths for files used either as input (DETECTION_PREFERENCES_FILE, CONF_FILE_FOLDER, SCORES_FILE_FOLDER, 
SETUP_FILE_FOLDER), intermediate step (SCORES_FILE), and output (OUTPUT_FOLDER). It is worth mentioning that 
DETECTION_PREFERENCES_FILE links to a file with the details of the validation part, such as which anomaly_threshold 
to choose, or which selected_checker strategy to choose.
